Predicting the results of future UK political opinion polls using sentiment analysis of tweets
This was my third year project for my computer science undergrad at the University of Warwick.
The final paper and code are in the Finished_project folder.
I received a 2:1 for this work.
I may return to the development of this application in the future.
